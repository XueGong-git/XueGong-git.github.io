## Higher-order Connection Laplacians for Directed Simplicial Complexes ##
Gong, X, Higham, D.J. and Zygalakis, K, and Bianconi, G.

Published in Journal of Physics: Complexity, 2023 [journal](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-072X/ad353b/meta) [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07631)

Higher-order networks encode the many-body interactions existing in complex systems, such as
the brain, protein complexes, and social interactions. Simplicial complexes are higher-order
networks that allow a comprehensive investigation of the interplay between topology and
dynamics. However, simplicial complexes have the limitation that they only capture undirected
higher-order interactions while in real-world scenarios, often there is a need to introduce the
direction of simplices, extending the popular notion of direction of edges. On graphs and networks
the Magnetic Laplacian, a special case of connection Laplacian, is becoming a popular operator to
address edge directionality. Here we tackle the challenge of handling directionality in simplicial
complexes by formulating higher-order connection Laplacians taking into account the
configurations induced by the simplicesâ€™ directions. Specifically, we define all the connection
Laplacians of directed simplicial complexes of dimension two and we discuss the induced
higher-order diffusion dynamics by considering instructive synthetic examples of simplicial
complexes. The proposed higher-order diffusion processes can be adopted in real scenarios when
we want to consider higher-order diffusion displaying non-trivial frustration effects due to
conflicting directionalities of the incident simplices.

## Generative hypergraph models and spectral embedding ##
Published in Scientic Report, 2023 [journal](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-27565-9) [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13895)

We consider the problem of embedding a hypergraph into low-dimensional Euclidean space so that most interactions are short-range. We focus on two spectral embedding algorithms customized to hypergraphs which recover linear and periodic structures respectively. We show that the two spectral hypergraph embedding algorithms are associated with a new class of generative hypergraph models. We demonstrate the hypergraph embedding and follow-on tasks -- including structure quantification, clustering and hyperedge prediction -- on synthetic and real-world hypergraphs. We also compare several triadic edge prediction methods on high school contact data where our algorithm improves upon benchmark methods when the amount of training data is limited.

## Directed network Laplacians and random graph models ##
Royal Society open science, 2021 [journal](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.211144) [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03026)

We consider spectral methods that uncover hidden structures in directed networks. We establish and exploit connections between node reordering via (a) minimizing an objective function and (b) maximizing the likelihood of a random graph model. We focus on two existing spectral approaches that build and analyse Laplacian-style matrices via the minimization of frustration and trophic incoherence. We show that reordering nodes using the two algorithms, or mapping them onto a specified lattice, is associated with new classes of directed random graph models. Using this random graph setting, we are able to compare the two algorithms on a given network and quantify which structure is more likely to be present. We illustrate the approach on synthetic and real networks, and discuss practical implementation issues.

## Large-area synthesis of monolayer and few-layer MoSe2 films on SiO2 substrates ## 

Published in Nano Letters, 2009 [journal](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl5000906)

We present successful synthesis of large area atomically thin MoSe2 films by selenization of MoO3 in a vapor transport chemical vapor deposition (CVD) system. Experiments reveal the high quality of as-grown MoSe2 in optics, and highlight the potential applications of the sample in nanoelectronics.
